Install
-------

From your cloned directory:

    ./install.sh

This will create symlinks for all config files in your home directory. You can
safely run this file multiple times to update.

Note that there is configuration for `zsh` so if you'd like to switch your shell from the default `bash` to `zsh`, on OS X you do:

    chsh -s /bin/zsh
